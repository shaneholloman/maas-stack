In this video tutorial, you will go hands-on and build your own simulated bare metal Kubernetes cluster using just a single computer üíª with Anton Smith, product manager for MAAS. Along the way, you‚Äôll get to use and learn about some Linux networking, MAAS, LXD, Ceph, Juju and Kubernetes, and at the end deploy an application to your new K8s cluster ‚ú®. 

To read more about the context for this tutorial, you should check out our bare metal Kubernetes whitepaper üìñ: https://ubuntu.com/engage/bare-metal-kubernetes
